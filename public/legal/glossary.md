## 🧠 Core System Concepts

- **Fluxline**  
  A mythic movement architected by Terence Waters. It teaches emotional stewardship, modular rituals, and mythic self-authorship. Not a brand—an ecosystem of transformation.

- **Resonance Core Framework (RCF)**  
  The master architecture of Fluxline. A modular system for coaching, curriculum, and legacy transmission. Includes archetypal mapping, somatic rituals, emotional ROI tracking, and ethical guardrails.

- **Somatic Mythmaker Curriculum**  
  A client-facing track within the RCF. Guides individuals through embodied transformation using mythic language, emotional thresholds, and modular rituals.

- **Curriculum Capsule**  
  A packaged offering that includes rituals, templates, and emotional ROI tools. Published through the Curriculum Publishing Protocol and aligned with seasonal archetypes.

- **Curriculum Evolution Framework**  
  A system for designing, refining, and scaling curriculum based on threshold sourcing, emotional ROI, client feedback, and seasonal recalibration.

- **Publishing Protocol**  
  A ritualized process for releasing curriculum into the public domain. Includes readiness audits, mythic packaging, portal activation, and legacy imprint.

- **Legacy Transmission**  
  The process of preserving and scaling mythic systems, rituals, and emotional data. Includes versioning, changelogs, backups, and symbolic documentation.

## 🔮 Mythic Language & Symbolism

- **Archetype**  
  A symbolic role or energetic frequency that a client embodies during transformation. Not a fixed identity—an evolving lens. Examples: Sovereign, Steward, Mythmaker, Alchemist, Oracle, Architect, Catalyst, Weaver.

- **Threshold**  
  A moment of emotional intensity, rupture, or choice that signals transformation. Examples: Creative friction, grief, expansion, rupture, clarity.

- **Creative Friction**  
  A threshold marked by tension or resistance in the creative process. Signals a need for recalibration or ritual response.

- **Mythic Language**  
  Symbolic, emotionally resonant vocabulary used to name thresholds, archetypes, rituals, and offerings. Transforms abstract experience into mythic clarity.

- **Mythic Authorship**  
  The act of designing one's life, business, and relationships as a mythic story. Involves ritualizing thresholds, embodying archetypes, and mapping legacy.

- **Co-Authorship**  
  A collaborative process where clients and mentors design rituals, offerings, and curriculum together. Based on mutual resonance and emotional stewardship.

- **Archetype-Domain Alignment**  
  Assigning archetypes to specific life domains to ensure clarity, resonance, and ethical authorship. Example: Sovereign governs financial decisions; Steward governs relational care.

- **Archetype Naming Ceremony**  
  A ritual where clients name and claim their mythic identity. Includes symbolic language, somatic activation, and emotional ROI reflection.

- **Sigil**
  A symbolic anchor (tattoo, mantra, object) that honors an archetype or threshold and the transformation that came from it.

- **Shadow Signal**
  A recurring emotional or behavioral pattern (e.g., ego, overachievement, distraction) that distorts resonance but reveals deeper mythic terrain.

- **Distortion Archetype**
  A personalized mythic identity that embodies a resonance disruptor (e.g., The Prover, The Escapist, The Performer).

- **Resonance Disruptor**
  Any internal or external force that pulls decisions away from DRIVE alignment—often masked as urgency, productivity, or validation.

- **Shadow Sigil**
  A symbolic anchor (tattoo, mantra, object) that honors a distortion archetype and its transformation.

## 💠 Emotional Stewardship & Somatic Tracking

- **Emotional ROI (Return on Intention)**  
  A metric for tracking the emotional impact of actions, rituals, and decisions. Measures resonance (alignment, clarity, empowerment) vs. dissonance (drain, confusion, rupture).

- **Emotional ROI (Distortion Layer)**
  A subfield within Emotional ROI tracking that logs the cost and clarity gained from distortion signals.

- **Resonance**  
  A felt sense of emotional alignment, clarity, and mythic expansion. Indicates integrity with one's archetype and legacy.

- **Dissonance**  
  A signal of emotional misalignment, energetic drain, or ethical rupture--the felt experience. See also Distortion.

- **Distortion**
  A resonance-disrupting force that alters perception, motivation, or decision-making—often masquerading as urgency, productivity, validation, or fear--it is the driving force of misalignment.

  > Distortion or dissonance are not failures; they are a mythic signal revealing where clarity is compromised and deeper authorship is required.

- **Somatic Signal**  
  A physical sensation that accompanies a threshold moment. Used to track emotional ROI and guide ritual response. Examples: Tight chest, fluttering stomach, grounded feet, open shoulders.

- **Living Ledger**  
  A dynamic journal or tracking system that logs emotional ROI, threshold moments, archetypal shifts, and ritual effectiveness.

- **Legacy Ledger**  
  A record of mythic impact—tracking offerings, mentorships, curriculum releases, and emotional ROI across time.

- **Distortion Map**
  A visual or ledger-based tool that tracks recurring disruptors, their emotional cost, and mythic lessons.

- **Mythic Audit**
  A reflective practice that compares a decision's origin (resonance vs. reaction) and names the archetypes involved.

- **Threshold Spiral**
  The cyclical journey through distortion, discomfort, and clarity—each loop deepening mythic authorship.

- **Drive vs. Distortion Protocol**
  A decision-making ritual that contrasts DRIVE signals with distortion archetypes to clarify alignment.

- **Ritual**  
  A repeatable, intentional practice designed to engage thresholds, embody archetypes, and recalibrate energy. Examples: Breathwork, journaling, movement, naming ceremonies.
