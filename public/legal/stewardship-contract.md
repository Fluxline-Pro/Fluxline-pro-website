**Integration**: Emotional resonance is embedded in every metric and model. True transformation occurs when inner awareness aligns with outer expression.

## Financial Terms

### Trial Period & Billing

New clients are offered up to **two complimentary sessions** to experience Fluxline's coaching container. These sessions are provided with no financial obligation and may be canceled at any time prior to the second or third session without charge, depending on the agreement.

Upon completion of the trial period, you agree to a **full monthly charge** for continued services. This charge reflects the value of the coaching container, emotional stewardship, and modular systems provided. Refunds are not issued for missed personal training sessions or repeated no-contact or no-show sessions unless due to emergency circumstances and at Fluxline’s discretion.

### Payment & Prepaid Services

All Fluxline services are offered on a **prepaid basis**. Payment is required upfront before coaching, consulting, or access to proprietary materials begins unless arranged beforehand by you and Fluxline (NET terms, deposits, etc.). This ensures energetic integrity, emotional stewardship, and mutual commitment to the transformational container.

- **No prorated refunds** are issued for unused time or services **after the 30-day window** from initial billing
- If cancellation occurs **within the first 30 days**, you may be eligible for a **partial refund**, subject to review and at Fluxline's discretion
- By submitting payment, you acknowledge and accept these terms as part of our shared covenant

This policy honors the sacred exchange of time, energy, and mythic investment—and protects the integrity of the coaching container.

### Refunds & Cancellations

- Refunds are not issued beyond a **30-day window** from the initial billing date
- Cancellations made within the first 30 days may be eligible for a partial refund, subject to review
- After 30 days, all payments are considered final and non-refundable
- Time purchased cannot be paused or suspended except under emergency circumstances at the discretion of Fluxline
- You may cancel future sessions by notifying us prior to the start of your next billing cycle, but refunds will not be issued for unused time beyond the 30-day window

**Example**: You sign up for a 3-month period. The 30-day window has expired, and you wish to cancel for the remainder of the program on day 40. This Agreement states Fluxline will not issue a refund for the remaining 50 days, as the 30-day window has passed.

For issues arising from the program, please contact us directly at [support@fluxline.pro](mailto:support@fluxline.pro) so we may promptly resolve your issue in good faith.
