- **No prorated refunds** are issued for unused time or services **after the 30-day window** from initial billing.

### 4. Refunds & Cancellations

Fluxline offers up to **two complimentary sessions** for new clients to experience our coaching and transformational services. These sessions are provided with no financial obligation and may be canceled at any time prior to the third session without charge.

Upon completion of the trial period, clients agree to a **full monthly charge** as outlined in the Client Agreement. This charge reflects the value of the coaching container, emotional stewardship, and modular systems provided.

- **Refunds are not issued** beyond a 30-day window from the initial billing date.
- Cancellations made within the first 30 days may be eligible for a partial refund, subject to review.
- After 30 days, all payments are considered final and non-refundable.
- Time purchased cannot be paused or suspended except under emergency circumstances at the discretion of Fluxline.
- You may cancel future sessions by notifying us prior to the start of your next billing cycle, but refunds will not be issued for unused time beyond the 30-day window.

  - This agreement states Fluxline will not issue a refund for the remaining 50 days, as the 30-day window has passed.
- For issues arising from the program, please contact us directly at [support@fluxline.pro]<mailto:support@fluxline.pro> so we may promptly resolve your issue in good faith.
