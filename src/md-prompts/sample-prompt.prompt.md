title: 'Sample Prompt'
author: Terence Waters
name: Sample Prompt
description: |
  This is a sample prompt to demonstrate the structure and content of a prompt.
  It includes sections for input, output, and constraints.
input:
  - type: text
    name: user_input
    description: |
      The input provided by the user. This can be any text that the model needs to process.
  - type: text
    name: context
    description: |
      Additional context or information that may help the model understand the input better.
output:
  - type: text
    name: response
    description: |
      The output generated by the model based on the input and context provided.
constraints:
  - type: time
    name: execution_time
    description: |
      The time limit for the model to generate a response. This ensures that the model does not take too long to respond.
  - type: length
    name: max_length
    description: |
      The maximum length of the output response. This prevents overly long responses that may not be useful.
  - type: format
    name: output_format
    description: |
      The format in which the output should be generated. This could be JSON, XML, plain text, etc.
  - type: content
    name: content_constraints
    description: |
      Any specific content constraints that the output must adhere to. This could include avoiding certain topics, using specific terminology, etc.
  - type: style
    name: style_constraints
    description: |
      Any specific style constraints that the output must adhere to. This could include tone, formality, etc.
  - type: examples
    name: example_responses
    description: |
      Examples of expected output responses. This helps the model understand the desired format and content.
  - type: constraints
    name: additional_constraints
    description: |
      Any additional constraints that are not covered by the previous sections. This could include ethical considerations, legal requirements, etc.
  - type: output
    name: expected_output
    description: |
      The expected output of the model based on the input and context provided. This should be a clear and concise description of what the model should produce.

Expected output and any relevant constraints for this task.
This prompt is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various use cases. The input and output sections can be modified to suit the specific needs of the task at hand. The constraints section provides a comprehensive overview of the limitations and requirements that the model must adhere to when generating a response.
This prompt is a template and can be customized further based on the specific requirements of the task. The sections can be expanded or modified as needed to provide more detailed instructions or constraints.
This prompt is a sample and can be used as a starting point for creating more complex prompts. The structure is designed to be clear and easy to understand, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
